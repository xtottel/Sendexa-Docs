# Billing Overview

Welcome to the **Sendexa Billing Overview**. This guide explains how our credit-based billing system works.

---

## How Billing Works

Sendexa operates on a **prepaid credit system**:
- Purchase credits in advance
- Credits are deducted per SMS sent
- No monthly fees or subscriptions
- Pay only for what you use

---

## Credit System

### What Are Credits?
Credits are the currency used to send SMS messages through Sendexa. Each SMS costs a specific number of credits based on:
- Destination country
- Message length
- Provider routing

### Credit Pricing
Standard pricing (Ghana):
- **Single SMS (160 chars):** 0.035 GHS per credit
- **Long SMS (>160 chars):** Multiple credits per message
- International rates vary by destination

## Payment Methods

Sendexa accepts the following payment methods:
- Mobile Money (MTN, Vodafone, AirtelTigo)
- Credit/Debit Cards (Visa, Mastercard)
- Bank Transfer
- PayPal (for international clients)

## Auto Top-Up

Enable **Auto Top-Up** to ensure uninterrupted service:
1. Go to **Billing → Settings**
2. Enable Auto Top-Up

When your balance falls below the threshold, credits are automatically added.
