# Authentication Guide

Welcome to the Authentication guide for forking the application from GitHub and setting up your development environment!

## What is MDX?

MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows you to write JSX (React components) inside your Markdown files. This means you can mix content with interactive components seamlessly.

For example, in a normal Markdown file, you might write:

```md
# Welcome to My Docs

This is a simple Markdown page.
```

But in MDX, you can add React components directly:

```ts
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

# Welcome to My Docs

This is a simple Markdown page with a button:

<Button>Click Me</Button>
```

## Creating an MDX File

To add a new documentation page, create a new `.mdx` file inside the `docs` directory:

```sh
echo "# My New Page" > docs/my-new-page.mdx
```

This file will automatically be picked up by the system and rendered as a new documentation page.

Your folder structure should look like this:

<FolderTree className="overflow-hidden p-2">
  <Folder element="project-root" defaultOpen={true}>
    <Folder element="docs" defaultOpen={true}>
      <File>
        <p>my-new-page.mdx</p>
      </File>
      <File>
        <p>another-page.mdx</p>
      </File>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</FolderTree>

🎉 That’s it! You now have a functional documentation site up and running with your first MDX page.
