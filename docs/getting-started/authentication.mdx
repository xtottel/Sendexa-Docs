# Authentication

Sendexa v2 uses **Token-based Authorization** for all API requests. This ensures a more secure, modern, and scalable system compared to legacy API key methods.

Every request you make must include a valid **Bearer Token**.

---

## How Authentication Works
Sendexa issues secure access tokens that uniquely identify your application. These tokens must be included in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Tokens allow you to authenticate without exposing your account credentials.

---

## Creating an API Token
To generate a new token:

1. Log in to the **Sendexa Dashboard**.
2. Go to **Settings → API Tokens**.
3. Click **Create Token**.
4. Copy and store the token securely.

You can create multiple tokens for different environments:
- **Production**
- **Development**
- **Staging**

---

## Using Tokens in API Requests
Here’s an example of adding your token in a standard request:

```http
POST /v2/sms/send HTTP/1.1
Host: smsc.sendexa.co
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json
```

---

## Token Scopes (Coming Soon)
Future versions of Sendexa will support scoped tokens such as:
- **sms.send**
- **otp.verify**
- **email.send**

This gives you finer control over token permissions.

---

## Securing Your Tokens
To keep your integration safe:
- Never expose tokens in frontend code.
- Regenerate a token immediately if exposed.
- Do not share your token with anyone.
- Use environment variables for storing tokens.

Example `.env` usage:
```
SENDEXA_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

---

## Rotating or Revoking Tokens
If a token becomes compromised:
1. Open **Settings → API Tokens**.
2. Select the token.
3. Click **Revoke**.
4. Generate a new token and update your applications.

---

## Testing Authentication
You can test token validity using `/v2/auth/check`:

```bash
curl -X GET https://smsc.sendexa.co/v2/auth/check \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

If successful, you’ll receive:
```json
{
  "status": "valid",
  "message": "Token is active."
}
```
