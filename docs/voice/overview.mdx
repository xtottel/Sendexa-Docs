## VoiceXML (Voice Markup)

Sendexa uses VoiceXML to control call flow. When a call is answered, Sendexa fetches VoiceXML from your specified URL.

### Basic VoiceXML Structure

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Say voice="female">Hello, welcome to our service</Say>
  <Play>https://yourapp.com/audio/welcome.mp3</Play>
  <Gather numDigits="1" action="/handle-input">
    <Say>Press 1 for Sales, 2 for Support</Say>
  </Gather>
</Response>
```

### VoiceXML Verbs

| Verb         | Purpose                   | Example                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `<Say>`      | Speak text using TTS      | `<Say>Hello World</Say>`        |
| `<Play>`     | Play audio file           | `<Play>audio.mp3</Play>`        |
| `<Gather>`   | Collect DTMF input        | `<Gather numDigits="4">`        |
| `<Record>`   | Record caller's voice     | `<Record maxLength="60">`       |
| `<Dial>`     | Connect to another number | `<Dial>233501234567</Dial>`     |
| `<Hangup>`   | End the call              | `<Hangup/>`                     |
| `<Redirect>` | Redirect to new URL       | `<Redirect>/new-url</Redirect>` |
| `<Pause>`    | Add silence               | `<Pause length="2"/>`           |
