# Rate Limits

To ensure stability and fairness for all clients, Sendexa enforces rate limits across different API categories.

## Global Limits
| Endpoint Group | Limit |
|----------------|--------|
| SMS API | 60 requests / minute |
| OTP API | 30 requests / minute |
| Email API | 50 requests / minute |

## When You Hit a Rate Limit
If your application exceeds the allowed rate, the API will respond with:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "message": "Too many requests. Try again later.",
  "retry_after": 30
}
```

## Avoiding Rate Limits
- Queue requests during high traffic
- Cache responses where possible
- Use bulk endpoints for batch operations
- Implement exponential backoff
