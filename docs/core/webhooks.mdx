# Webhooks

Webhooks allow your system to receive real-time updates from Sendexa for events such as SMS delivery, OTP verification, and more.

## How Webhooks Work
1. You provide a callback URL.
2. Sendexa sends a POST request whenever an event occurs.
3. Your system acknowledges with a **200 OK** response.

## Example Delivery Webhook Payload
```json
{
  "event": "sms.delivery",
  "message_id": "MSG-99332",
  "status": "DELIVERED",
  "recipient": "+233501234567",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-12T12:45:30Z"
}
```

## Expected Response
Your webhook endpoint must return:
```http
200 OK
```
within **5 seconds**.

## Security
- Include signature validation (coming soon)
- Use HTTPS always

## Retry Policy
If your system does not respond with 200 OK, Sendexa will retry:
- 3 attempts
- With exponential backoff
